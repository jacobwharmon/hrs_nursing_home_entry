# Health index

## Objective: Can we construct a better health index than NBER wp 32971?

## Data: Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) [link](https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/)
	* [RAND HRS Longitudinal File](https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/rand-hrs-longitudinal-file-2020)

## Project:
	* read the paper
		* think about whether I want to look at predictors of Y=Nursing Home, or Y=Death, or Y=Retirement

	* download the data
	* training data in the paper is:
		* respondents younger than 100
		* identifying as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, or Hispanic
		* Our sample consists of 216,166 individual-year observations

	* construct NBER index
		* Appendix C
			* 

	* construct my index
	* how did the two indexes perform on the test data (2020, maybe do 2018 and 2020)

	* compare/contrast and discuss intuition



## Promising features:
	* number of living children
	* proxy filing & low cognitive score
	* number of living children & low cognitive score
	* objectively bad health & self-reported subjective good health
	* measure of pain is in the HRS (non-RAND) that needs to be joined in
